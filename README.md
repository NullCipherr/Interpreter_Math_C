## üöÄ Features

- **Mathematical Expression Evaluation**:
  - Supports basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `%`.
  - Supports logical operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR).
  - Factorial calculation using `!`.

- **Mathematical Functions**:
  - `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`, `log(x)`, `sqrt(x)`.

- **Variable Management**:
  - Define variables: `x = 5`.
  - Use variables in expressions: `x + 10`.

- **Calculation History**:
  - View the history of previous calculations.
  - Export the history to a `.txt` file.

- **Simple and User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Clear menus and commands to interact with the program.
